# CS246 Fall 2020 Final Project

The final project for the CS246 course (in the Fall 2020 term) at the University of Waterloo.


At the present moment, I seek to make the game "straights," as described in [straights.pdf](./straights.pdf)



## Dependencies

- StarUML (for reading `UML_DD1.mdj`)

- g++ for compilation



## How to run / build

1. In the command line, run the `make` command

2. Play the game by running the executable `straights`
